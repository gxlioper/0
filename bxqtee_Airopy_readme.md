# **Airopy - Wireless Packet Capture**

Get clients and access points. With Alfa cards this script works correctly.

## Dependencies

To run this script first install requirements as follows:

```[python]
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

## How to use

In the examples I don't add 'sudo', but to execute them you need high privileges.

To get help:
```[python]
python3 airopy.py -h
```

To get APS:

```[python]
python3 airopy.py -i wlx00c0ca81fb80 --aps
```

To get Stations:
```[python]
python3 airopy.py -i wlx00c0ca81fb80 --stations
```

To get APS and Stations:
```[python]
python3 airopy.py -i wlx00c0ca81fb80 --aps --stations
```

To filter by a particular vendor:
```[python]
python3 airopy.py -i wlx00c0ca81fb80 --stations -d 0
```

To filter mac vendors, please check the number in mac_vendors.py. This last option can return unwanted devices, as it is based on the following unvalidated prefixes on my part:

* [aallan](https://gist.github.com/aallan/b4bb86db86079509e6159810ae9bd3e4)
* [WiFiBroot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hash3liZer/WiFiBroot/master/utils/macers.txt)

If you use it in America, add --america.
