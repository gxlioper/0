# Homebrew Core

Core formulae for the Homebrew package manager.

Core formulae for the Linuxbrew package manager (Homebrew on Linux or Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux) are in [Homebrew/linuxbrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core).

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew install  `. This is the default tap for Homebrew and is installed by default.
