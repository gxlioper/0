# AssetBundleParser #
`AssetBundleParser` is a tool to compare and merge Unity assetbundle.

`AssetBundleParser` isn't robust. If it's used to load a file of wrong format, it'll crash. There are two reasons:

1. The format of assetbundle is private. The code is kept simple, so that if it fails to parse a file of right format and crashes, it'll be ease to compare the source code with `disunity` to find locate the bug.
1. It's easy to verify if a file is of right format by using md5, it's unnecessary to add too much error-check and recovery code which only complicates the source.

At current only uncompressed `assetbundle` is supported. This is because  Lzma compression speed is very slow. So when create a bundle, options like `BuildOptions.UncompressedAssetBundle` or `BuildAssetBundleOptions.UncompressedAssetBundle` shall be used.

# Compatibility #

	Unity 				| Support
	---  				| --- 		
	4.6 				| √ 
	5.0 				| ×		

## Usage ##
1. Call `assetbundle_diff` to generate a diff file.
1. Call `assetbundle_merge` to merge diff file.

*The diff file isn't compressed. Compress it before sending to network if needed.*
