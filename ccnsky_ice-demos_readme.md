# Ice Demos

The ice-demos repository provides sample programs for Ice.

## Layout

The sample programs are grouped by programming language:
* [C++11](./cpp11)
* [C++98](./cpp98)
* [C#](./csharp)
* [Java](./java)
* [Java-Compat](./java-compat)
* [JavaScript](./js)
* [MATLAB](./matlab)
* [Objective-C](./objective-c)
* [PHP](./php)
* [Python](./python)
* [Ruby](./ruby)
* [Swift](./swift)
* [TypeScript](./typescript)

For example, the [cpp11](./cpp11) folder contains all the sample programs written
in C++ that demonstrate the Ice C++11 mapping.

The [certs](./certs) folder contains X.509 certificates shared by some of these
sample programs.

## Platform Support

The sample programs are not all available on all platforms. For example, the
[C#](./csharp) sample programs are currently only for Windows and were not
tested on any other platform.

## Building and Running the Sample Programs

The README.md file in each language subdirectory provides instructions for
building and running the sample programs.
