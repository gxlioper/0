## Usage

You don't need use the javascript source files. You only need include `hprose-html5.js` in your html.

### Exception Handling

If an error occurred on the server, or your service function/method throw an exception, it will be sent to the client. You need to pass an error callback function after succuss callback function to receive it. If you omit this callback function, the client will ignore the exception, like never happened.

For example:

```html
 
 
  
 
 
 
    var client = new hprose.HttpClient("http://www.hprose.com/example/", ["hello"]);
    client.hello("World!", function(result) {
        alert(result);
    }, function(name, err) {
        alert(err);
    });
 
 
```
