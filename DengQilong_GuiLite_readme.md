# Welcome to GuiLite
 
     
 
 
   
   
   
   
 
 The smallest header-only GUI library (5 KLOC) for all platforms. 
 
     
 

- [中文](README_zh.md)

## Lightweight
- ✂️Small: Just under 5,000 lines of C++ and header-only: GuiLite.h
- ⚡Fast: Render a GUI within one invocation, independent of any OS or 3rd party library
- 💉Embeddable: Runs inside Qt/MFC/Winform/Cocoa/Web - Keep legacy Qt/MFC code reusable
- ⚙️️Hardware Minimum Requirements:

    | Processor | Disk/ROM space | Memory |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 24 MHZ | 29 KB | 9 KB |

## Cross platform
- Supported OSes: iOS/macOS/WathOS, Android, Linux, Windows, RTOS... or **MCU without OS**
- Supported languages: C/C++, Swift, Java, Javascript, C#, Golang...
- Supported 3rd party libraries: Qt, MFC, Winforms, CoCoa...

## Useful features
- 🔣Multi-language, supports UTF-8
- 🔨[Toolkit](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLiteToolkit) for building font/image resources
- 📐[Layout GUI WYSIWYG](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLitePreviewer)
- ☁️Cloud + IoT Solution
- 📊Code Telemetry and Analysis in real time
- 📦Supports 3D and [Web](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLiteWeb)
- 🐋Run in docker with a single command: `sudo docker run -it --privileged -v /dev:/dev-share idea4good/gui-lite:latest bash /run.sh`

## Easy to learn and support
Even a C beginner could master GuiLite quickly. The source code only uses basic C++ features (class, virtual function). We chose C++ as it could make the code size significantly smaller and easier to read.
