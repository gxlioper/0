# Densenet

Sorry to submit this way, but my local config with github somehow conflicts with gitee, so I can not push the whole working directory, instead I only upload the changed files: densenet.py and train_eval_images_classifier.

The uncertain issue is with batch size, I tried 16 and 8, and got error message about out of memory. Then I switch to 4.

Here is the screenshot from tinymind, you can also access to my model on tinymind via:
