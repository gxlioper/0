## A Simple Five Chess Game Based On Slick2D

It is written in Java using [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) and [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/), wrappers around the OpenGL and OpenAL libraries. It runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms.

### Java Setup

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed in order to run opsu!. The download page is located here.

- [ ] TODO

### Build On Maven

Maven builds are built to the `target` directory.

* To run the project, execute the Maven goal `compile`.
* To create a single executable jar, execute the Maven goal `package -Djar`. This will compile a jar to `target/five-chess-${version}.jar` with the libraries, resources and natives packed inside the jar. Setting the "XDG" property (`-DXDG=true`) will make the application use XDG folders under Unix-like operating systems.
