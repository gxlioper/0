Solar power gives long term returns however the initial cost of setting up is quite high. India
being a tropical country has huge potential for generating solar energy, but the citizens need
to be further incentivized.
 
   
 

# Architecture Flow

 
   
 

1. The administrator interacts with Decentralized Energy UI comprising of Angular framework
2. The application processes user requests to the network through a REST API.
3. Implements requests to the Blockchain state database on Hyperledger Fabric v1
4. The REST API is used to retrieve the state of the database
5. The Angular framework gets the data through GET calls to the REST API

# Included Components

* Hyperledger Composer
* Angular Framework
* Loopback
