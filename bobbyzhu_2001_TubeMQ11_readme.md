# TubeMQ

[README in Chinese](README.cn.md)

TubeMQ is a distributed messaging queue (MQ) system developed by Tencent Big Data since 2013. It focuses on high-performance storage and transmission of massive data in big data scenarios.

After nearly seven years of massive data precipitation, TubeMQ has certain advantages in production practice (stability + performance) and low cost compared to many open source MQ projects. Recently we open source related code and design for TubeMQ project. You can find more information and documentations under /docs. More information and documentation (in English) will get uploaded soon.
