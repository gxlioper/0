## Game Flow

1. a random play zone is generated >> mission admin can repeat in case play zone isn't fair
2. all spawn points and delivery points for the *Courier* are marked on the map
3. players spawn at their respective spawn point - the *Courier* can move out instantly, the other parties have to wait a while
4. the *Briefcase* is being marked on the map in specific intervals
5. the *Courier* makes his deliveries
6. the other parties try to intercept the *Courier* and steal the *Briefcase*
7. if a party succeeds, they have to take the *Briefcase* back to an exfil point and defend it until their pick up arrives


## The Briefcase

The *Briefcase* is being tracked. In certain intervals, a marker will appear on the map, indicating the approximate position of the *Briefcase*.

The marker will appear more often and be more accurate when:

* someone other than the *Courier* is carrying the *Briefcase*
* the *Briefcase* or its carrier is in a vehicle
* no one is carrying the *Briefcase*

Notes about interacting with the *Briefcase*:

* while on the ground, it can be picked up with ACE-Interaction
* the carrier can not sprint
* if the carrier is killed, loses consciousness, surrenders or takes out a weapon, he will drop the *Briefcase*
* the *Briefcase* can not be loaded into vehicles by itself, but the carrier can mount a vehicle without dropping it
* if the carrier is killed or loses consciousness while inside a vehicle, the *Briefcase* will fall out of the vehicle
* the carrier can give the *Briefcase* to another player by ACE-Interacting with that player
* the carrier can drop the *Briefcase* with ACE-Selfinteraction

## Sides

There are four playable sides in Money in the Mist. The mission will work just fine if one side is empty, only the Courier *has* to exist. So you could for example play Blu/Opf/Civ or even Opf/Civ and make it an all out man hunt.

### The Courier

The *Courier* is doing his shady business delivering to other civilians or placing deliveries in dead drops. He has to complete his side missions before he can do his main delivery and win the game.

* has to complete 4 out of 6 side deliveries
* can choose to join another side if threatened with violence (ACE-Interact with enemy he wants to join)
* he can then defect from that side again and flee (ACE-Selfinteraction)
* looks just like every other civilian on the map
* starts with a vehicle that has some equipment inside

### Special Forces

The Special Forces were sent by the local government to intercept the *Courier* and secure the *Briefcase* as part of an investigation against drug trafficking. Their order is to not unnecessarily harm the *Courier*, but hey, he might just accidentally catch a stray bullet.

### Mafia

The Russian Mafia in this country doesn't play around. Cheap drugs are ruining their business and they are going to put an end to it.

### Rebels

The Rebels plan on using the *Briefcase's* contents to finance their next arms deal. This rebellion is won with guns and ammo and the Rebels are running low on both.

## Ranked Mode

Ranked mode is a mission parameter that is enabled by default. Wins/losses of individual players and of each side will be saved and displayed on mission end. The *Courier* is exempt from this statistic, as he will lose most games anyway. Instead, the *Courier* gets points for different accomplishments that are saved in a separate statistic. At the end of the mission, a separate *Courier* highscore leaderboard will be displayed.

The *Courier* gets points for:

* completing side deliveries
* completing the main delivery (winning the game)
* surviving
* joining the side that wins the game

## Play Zone

The play zone is completely randomly generated every game. The mission admin can decline the playzone, if it is unfair for one side (e.g. if a side starts on an island) with the chat command `#mitm_decline`. There are random civilians walking and driving around the playzone. Civilian vehicles can be stopped and highjacked. There are also random empty vehicles parked in towns and sparsely outside of towns. These are locked, but can be broken into with the lock pick kit that every player starts with. The *Courier* is better at lock picking than his adversaries.
