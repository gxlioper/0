# number_slide_animation

With this package you can display a number using a neat sliding animation.

![Sample](./pub_assets/sample.gif)

```dart
class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Simple Example"),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: Center(
          child: NumberSlideAnimation(
            number: "12345678987654321",
            duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
            curve: Curves.bounceIn,
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 20.0,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

I wanted this kind of Animation in my application and thought some of you may want to use it too.
It is very easy to set up and can be used for example as a neat intro animation.
